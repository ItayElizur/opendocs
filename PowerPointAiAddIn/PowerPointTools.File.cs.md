# PowerPointTools.File.cs

## `save`

`save` is advertised from Track Changes up. It is in neither `readOnlyTools` nor
`commentOnlyExtraTools` in `entry.ts`, and the C# gate treats every tool outside
`AlwaysAllowedTools` as mutating, so Read Only and Comment Only block it server-side
too. No tier-list edits are needed for it.

`saveAs` defaults to false (save in place, overwriting the file). It must be true
whenever the user wants a copy, a new name, another folder or another format - the
schema text says so explicitly. A never-saved file (empty `Path`) goes to the Save As
UI even when `saveAs` is false, because there is no path to save to.

PowerPoint has no Dialogs collection, so the Save As path uses Application.FileDialog[msoFileDialogSaveAs]
(present on _Application in the referenced PIA). FileDialog.Show() only picks the target (-1 confirmed, 0 cancelled);
the save itself happens in FileDialog.Execute(). `Execute` in PowerPointTools.cs skips
StartNewUndoEntry() for `save` (nothing to undo).

The Save As UI is modal and runs synchronously on PowerPoint's UI thread, inside the
WebView2 `WebMessageReceived` handler, so the chat pane is frozen until the user saves
or cancels. There is no tool-call timeout (`callDotNetTool` is a bare promise) and the
AbortSignal is never forwarded to C#, so Stop cannot dismiss the dialog. This is
accepted. A cancel returns a non-error "cancelled" result with `Mutated = false`, so
the model does not retry in a loop.

NOT VERIFIED AGAINST LIVE POWERPOINT: compiles clean in Debug and Release, and the dialog
members were confirmed to exist in the referenced PIA by reflection, but neither the
in-place save nor the dialog (including cancel detection) was exercised against a
running instance.
